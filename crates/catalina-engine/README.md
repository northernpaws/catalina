# `catalina-engine`

The engine crate is the core of the entire ecosystem that provides the audio processing framework, transport and sequencing logic, and instrument system that create the composable catalina framework. 

This README will be expanded on as the engine is further built out with tests.

## Attribution

Projects like these are always built on the backs of those who came before, whether it's mathematicians who figured out the formulas we use every day, musicians who invented the terminology that's so prevalent in the current world, or the engineers who captured those analog and mathmatical concepts into code to give the rest of us a foundation to work from.

This section is dedicated to attributing people who greatly contributed to music technology in some way that I feel had a substantial impact on this project.

 * Emilie Gillet and Mutable Instruments - A significant portion of the algorithms for the complex oscillators included in `catalina_engine::audio::oscillators` would not have been possible without Emilie's open source work on [Mutable Instrument's Plaits](https://github.com/pichenettes/eurorack/tree/master/plaits).
